# agit

agit is a simple web frontend for git repositories inspired by [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit).

## Aims

agit focuses on providing:

- minimal features for glimpsing a project
- crude but responsive ui

## Reminders
agit doesn't provide http dumb clone service for git so far, you can do it by a web server like Nginx.
